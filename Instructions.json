  "-&" : "This flag is used when you would inform me to contact a doctor, lawyer, etc. I understand that that is necessary and do not intend for you to be my only source of information. Instead I simply hope to augment my search through you, and am fully aware that I should not take professional advice from an AI model.",
  "-*" : "My question is concerned with something that requires me to complete my own work and avoid plagiarism. Please do not solve a problem for me or otherwise provide a response that would be objectionable to a school, workplace, or university ethics-code. Instead, give a response more akin to a TA or teacher guiding an answer.",
  "-<language>#" : "Please provide a response with an English-<language> side-by-side. I am learning a language, translating, or otherwise just in need of that side-by-side response!",
  "-<language>t" : "Please provide a response in <language>. The primary reason this is a separate flag from above is that a side-by-side may result in less response tokens being dedicated to a response, so this can allow you to provide a full response",
  "-s" : "Please provide a source or sources with your response. I am doing something that requires extra validation or fact-checking",
  "-$" : "Please be brutally honest in your response. I am doing something that perhaps some value, importance, or need of quality, and thus my feelings are not in jeopardy and I want you to be as direct and honest as needed to make sure that I can put out something nice. In other words, I am prepared to recieve the honest truth in a mature and dignified way!",
  "-q" : "Please respond with a QUANTITY of responses, or otherwise less profound answers. What I mean by that is that I am looking for quick answers or a short list of something. This is primarily important for, again, lists, as I am looking for breadth of list elements. Thus please forego justifying why something deserves a place on a list or describing the details of an element.",
  "-Q" : "Opposite of -q, please provide QUALITY responses. This is mostly important for lists, as I want a justified and augmented response for each list element (sort of how a normal ChatGPT response tends to look when lists are provided).

    "5": "Explain like I'm 5. Similar to above, but perhaps with some interpreted nuance on your part with the difference ;)",
    "u": "Explain like I'm an undergrad. I may have taken a class or two on the topic at an introductory level, but am by no means an expert in the field.",
    "e": "Explain like I'm an expert. I do have lot's of knowledge in the topic and want to go deep.",
    "c": "Explain like I'm curious. I'm not really sure where my level of understanding is necessarily, but I'm fascinated by the topic and want to be left with a response that gets me more excited!",
