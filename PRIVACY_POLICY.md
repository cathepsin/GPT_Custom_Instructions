## argsGPT Privacy Policy

### Introduction
argsGPT is an AI-powered tool designed to assist users in generating responses based on input prompts.
We prioritize your privacy and do not collect anything from you. This is merely a tool that allows for
extended instructions to allow one to exceed the character limits for a typical customized GPT.
We do not intend for this to change, as our only goal is to improve ChatGPT as a tool. We use
this in our own workspace, and simply feel it could be useful elsewhere. Honestly, we don't
even care that much about making the "best" tool out there, we just dumped in here what we commonly preempt a 
prompt with so we could be even more lazy.

### Data Collection
There is a single possible http request that retrieves this link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cathepsin/GPT_Custom_Instructions/refs/heads/main/Instructions.json

Given this, no data is collected on our side of things. The only data collected is that by OpenAI from
normal usage of ChatGPT, which is not provided to us.

### Data Sharing
Your input data is not shared with third parties. 

### User Rights
argsGPT does not retain any personal data except as already stated by OpenAI in their more
general terms of use and privacy policy. We don't care about holding your data so we don't,
and that won't change.

### Changes to This Privcacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy. We will attempt to notify a user that changes
have been made by prompting argsGPT to communicate this in the first message of a new
conversation, but ultimately the rersponsibility lies with the end-user to be aware of
this policy or any changes.
